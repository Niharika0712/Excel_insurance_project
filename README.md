# Excel_insurance_project
This is an end-to-end Excel project.
In this Project, I have used a dataset of an Insurance Company with some other pieces of information of customers like Age, Sex, BMI, Charges, and others.
Using the dataset, I have created a dashboard of the Health Insurance of that dataset.
I first cleaned the Data, then extracted it, and finally visualized it using Pivot Tables. I also provided slicers to determine the relationship between the charts based on the dataset used.
